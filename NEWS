aria2 1.28.0
============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes the bug that file name is not logged with
--conditional-get option is used.  The new option
--keep-unfinished-download-result was added to keep incomplete
downloads in memory regardless of --max-download-result so that we can
save those downloads with --save-session option.  This option is
enabled by default.

This release

Changes
-------

* Restore LTLIBINTL in src/Makefile.am

  Patch from Juan Francisco Cantero Hurtado

* Add --keep-unfinished-download-result option

  This option keeps unfinished download results even if doing so
  exceeds --max-download-result.  This is useful if all unfinished
  downloads must be saved in session file (see --save-session option).
  Please keep in mind that there is no upper bound to the number of
  unfinished download result to keep.  This option is enabled by
  default.

* Fix -Wexpansion-to-defined warning with clang-3.9

  The error message was:

  warning: macro expansion producing 'defined' has undefined behavior
  [-Wexpansion-to-defined]
